- 👋 Hi, I’m @elmiow, a she/her data enthusiast with a science background in climate impact analysis, used to dealing with very large datasets of different data sources and formats. Even if I'd love to share most of my code, I will only be able to do so after officially having earned my PhD in Dec 2021. Still, I'd like to share some of my beautiful plot functions for use with the R packages ggplot2 and tmap that I have written to enrich my scientific publications.
- 👀 I’m interested and experienced in using R, multivariate and non-linear datat analysis, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, passionate about geospatial data, beautiful graphs and maps and lapply()
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and improving my python skills - always keen on learning new tricks to constantly improve my code
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's interesting and can bring progress to others or myself
- 📫 How to reach me... is currently unavailable
